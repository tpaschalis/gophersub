I like to have a 'whiteboard' for my projects.

It gets really messy, real quick, but provides a way to write down my thoughts, look back on previous design decisions, reason on future approaches, jot down various tests I've done and failed.

This is done best with pen-and-paper, but since I'm using Git, I'll try to go for digital.


## Design

Since I've now started with writing functionality, I'm not yet sure what will be the best way to package the whole thing, as a library, to enable it to be used as a cli application and whatnot. 

Because I'm lazy, I'll be throwing everything into `main.go`, and the structure will emerge later on.


I am not sure how to handle whole subtitle files.    
I am pretty confident with each subtitle being a struct like this will do, (maybe add another `metadata` field).
```go
Subtitle struct {
	Index    int
	Start    time.Duration
	End      time.Duration
	Content string
}
```

I am still on the fence about the whole file though. It can take a bunch of different forms.
```go
var subfile []Subtitle

var subfile map[int]subtitle

type subfile struct {
		subs []Subtitle
		metadata string
}
```

I think I might go with the KISS principle and just use a slice.
It's ordered, can be easily iterated, avoid nested structs, easy for others to use as API in the future.

## Testing


## Functions

### func durationToTimestamp()

There are a bunch of possible ways to conver a `time.Duration` to an SRT timestamp. If I were to write this in Python, I'd be using something like `datetime.timedelta`, so I think of `time.Duration` as something analogous

	// Some possible ways to convert Golang duration to SRT timestamp


Way 1 - Act directly on the duration object.   
Why it's bad : 
```go
	// Way 1 : Directly act on the duration object
	//days := int64(d.Hours() / 24)
	//hours := int64(math.Mod(d.Hours(), 24))
	//minutes := int64(math.Mod(d.Minutes(), 60))
	//seconds := int64(math.Mod(d.Seconds(), 60))
	//millis := int64(math.Mod(float64(d.Nanoseconds()), 1000)) * 1000
	//millis := float64(d) / float64(time.Millisecond)
	//fmt.Println(days, hours, minutes, seconds, millis)
```

Way 2 : Use Sscanf to 'scan' the formatted string from the object's `.String()` method    
Whu it's bad :
```go
var hour, minute, second, milli int
fmt.Sscanf(s.String(), "%dh%dm%d.%ds", &hour, &minute, &second, &milli)
fmt.Println(hour, minute, second, milli)

// basically
var hour, minute, second, milli int
var s float64
fmt.Sscanf(d.String(), "%dh%dm%fs", &hour, &minute, &s)
second = int(s)
milli = int(math.Mod(s*1000., 1000))
fmt.Println(hour, minute, second, milli)
```

Way 3 : Regular expressions    
Now you have one more problem and whatnot


Way 4 : The way I made it initially work. BUT   
it works for *very specific* formatted strings. It absolutely fails if e.g. you provide a duration that does not contain hours or minutes, and `Sscanf` just puts the first value it finds (s) in the 'hour' bucket.

This was one of the cases that was immediately obvious once I wrote some tests, and pointed me to keep on writing them and not get lazy.
```go
var hour, minute int
var second float64
fmt.Println(d)
fmt.Sscanf(d.String(), "%dh%dm%fs", &hour, &minute, &second)
res := fmt.Sprintf("%02d:%02d:%02.3f", hour, minute, second)
```

Way 5 : The way it currently works     
Using the native method of parsing the object and acting on its components is the easiest and most concise method I've found.
*It also allows for future improvements*, such as converting to another format of timestamps, for other subtitle files.
```go
func DurationToTimestamp(d time.Duration) string {
	var hour, minute int
	var second float64
	stringDuration, err := time.ParseDuration(d.String())
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Could not parse provided time.Duration")
		panic(err)
	}
	hour = int(stringDuration.Hours())
	minute = int(math.Mod(stringDuration.Minutes(), 60))
	second = math.Mod(stringDuration.Seconds(), 60)

	res := fmt.Sprintf("%02d:%02d:%02.3f", hour, minute, second)
	return res
```

### func StrToDuration()
I probably could get away without testing this function, but at least I found out more about error handling, and about writing tests for specific errors.

I'm using the wrapper instead of going full in with `time.ParseDuration`, to be able to extend it later when it's going to take cli arguments as well.
